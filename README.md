"I;m thinking about thos Beans" - Ancient American proverb

FYI: If you're wondering why my commits are crazy high, I am _not_ using one of those lame auto-contributor to inflate my stats; I hate those things! I have Postman hooked up to a private repo to copy over updates to my PM collections. I might remove the integration because it makes my real contributions _look_ fake.

I document some of the stuff I do on and off of GitHub [on my blog](blog.mikecodes.software).
