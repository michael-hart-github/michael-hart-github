- 👋 Hi, I’m @michael-hart-github
- 👀 I’m interested in running computer simulations ([Double Pendulum](https://github.com/DinoZ1729/Double-Pendulum), [Hydraulic Erosion](https://github.com/SebLague/Hydraulic-Erosion), etc.) I like learning how to poke around more efficently in GitHub and offer a bit of feedback, occasionally.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create websites with HTML and CSS. I'm hoping to get into Javascript, and *maybe* Python at some point. I've tried many programming and scripting languages before, but run out of steam every time.
- 💞️ I’m currently collaborating on some various private repos. Nothing terribly interesting. I've got a few public things, notes and tests, primarily. There's also a few archived tutorial repos from the [Learning Lab](learn.github.com) which were enlightening.
- 📫 How can you reach me? I'm not Mr. Popular or anything, but I suppose you could @ me on here, or through my website? Speaking of...
- 💻 Checkout my [Photography Website](https://www.hartphotographs.com/) 📸 to see some of my snazzy photos! I've got stuff for sale on there too, if you're interested. *You know you want to.*
