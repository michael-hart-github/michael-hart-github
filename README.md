Hi, I'm Mike. Thanks for stopping in.

I use GitHub to store notes on random stuff for work & personal use; WebDev and CyberSec mostly, but some other stuff too.

On a _way_ too personal note: I finally got some meds, so I can FOCUS on stuff I actually want to do now, not just EVERY SINGLE THING that enters my brainspace! ðŸŽ† (These emoji's are weak!)

Lately, I've been going crazy on Linux terminal commands. I snagged a NAS last year for Plex and Calibre - I'm working with a good sized filesystem, and I feel like I have real, actual practical use-case for terminal commands now. It's not just 3 word text files, it's actual documents (pdfs and stuff).

I've also been messing around with Docker a lot - I stood up Calibre and Calibre web on it. I had a reverse proxy w/ Nginx going through a container too, but scrapped it because it was a bit much for what my actual use case is. Anyway, containerization is super neat - I totally get why people love it, and I see the addictive nature to it but honestly...I still think bare metal is _way_ cooler. Who doesn't want a rackmount in their basement keeping their home roasting in the middle of the winter?! Who doesn't want the roar of 30 harddrives screaming for the sweet release of death? Who doesn't yearn for the vauge, continual middle-of-the-night fear of blackouts (and the electric bill.) What kind of weirdo doesn't want to slog through the agonizing, soul crushing churn of Patch Tuesday?! I miss it! Honestly, I miss it super hard. Data centers are for chumps and cowards. Give me UPS, or give me outages!

For 2025 I'm looking to get into Webscraping (gotta use those TBs!) That, or maybe I can do something with C? (Maybe Torvals can curse me out) Or Rust? (See previous) I don't know! I need to do something, though. I feel like a total and complete idiot at computer stuff. And Web stuff. And security stuff. I want to learn everything, but feel like I don't know enough of anything of it to say I'm good at it (even if it's my literal job I get paid a ton of money for.) I've been doing this stuff since...what? 2010? And I still feel like a drooling moron most of the time. Either that's an ego issue, or it's unbelievably easy to work with computers! "Both are equally terrifying."

All I really know is I don't particularly like Java or C#. Too much type-y for not enough do-y.

I've got Twitter, HackerNews, reddit, and all of that good stuff, but what kind of loser links work and pleasure together?! Why would I WANT you to know that? So I can never write anything funny ever again in an unguarded, genuine way, in the off chance some potential hiring manager combs through years of social media shitposting? Those are _fun_ places to get _away_ from work! Don't be lame! Keep that stuff seperate! GitHub is like the smelly weird kid of LinkedIn & (a more practical version of) LeetCode. Who wants recruiters seeing what subreddit you're whining in? Do they want to know if you prefer Helldivers 2 over DRG?! (It's obviously DRG, by the way) Just keep the work _stuff_ in the work _place_. (Is that why it's called that?!)

Honestly, if you want to hire me, I mean...I've already got a job, so it would be kind of weird. But if you want to ask me something, just ask. michael.v.hart@outlook.com. Just don't cyberstalk my social media.ðŸ˜… (Seriously, please don't do that.)
